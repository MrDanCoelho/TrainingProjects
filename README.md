Projects for training basic operations

## Exercises:

- [ ] Create a Console project that will receive 2 names from the user and return the names combined and separated by an empty space. Eg: User inputs "Daniel" and "Henrique", the console should output "Daniel Henrique"

- [ ] Create a Console project that will receive 2 numbers from the user and return the multiplication of those numbers. Eg: User inputs "2" and "3", the console should output "2x3=6"

- [ ] Create a Console project that will continuously receive names from the user until the user inputs an empty string, them the console should output all those names separated by commas. Eg: User inputs "Daniel", "Vitor" and "André", the console should output "Daniel, Vitor, André"

- [ ] Extra: create a Console project that will receive an integer number from the user. The number SHOULD be > 0, otherwise the program should throw an exception. Then, sum this number with 2,147,483,647 and output the value. Can you explain what has happened?

## Helpful Stuff

**System.Console.WriteLine():** Used to WRITE something to the console

**System.Console.ReadLine()** Used to READ something from the console

**string:** a variable type that can receive letters

**int:** a variable type that receives integer numbers

**List<string>** a variable type that receives a list of strings

**if(x){}:** checks if condition "x" is true

**while(x){}:** a loop that will run until condition "x" is met. Eg: while(nome != "") will run while "nome" is not an empty string

**foreach(var x in y){}:** a loop that will run for all values in "y"

**throw new Exception():** a command to throw an exception
